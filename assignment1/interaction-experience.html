        The first thing I noticed about this website was its clean and
        minimalistic nature. The simple colour palette of black, white and grey
        made the content visually appealing and easy to understand. Reinforcing
        this, the professional but simple looking font contributed to the
        overall unified design. There was no overload of information, and the
        buttons and text were all well spaced with padding. Even the background
        image looked like it was specifically designed for this website as it
        had a distinct style, portraying that she was in complete control of the
        aesthetic.

      <!-- Used ul and li for dotpoints instead of a single sentence -->
      <ul id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        <li>
          Scrolled down the page to explore content and saw if there was any
          special animations.
        </li>

        <li>
          Observed the cursor to check for uniqueness as seen with the other
          featured websites.
        </li>

        <li>
          Clicked the ‘Explore Projects’ button to see where it led - went down
          the page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clicked the ‘See My Resume’ button, which opened a separate Google
          Drive page containing the resume.
        </li>
        <li>
          Examined how different sections were linked and structured within the
          site.

          with?:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        Since the website is relatively simple, I spent the most time clicking
        through the navigation buttons and viewing the projects and resume.
        Nothing really popped out at the user, but that isn’t necessarily a bad
        thing, the website only consisted of the core important information to
        effectively get her professional experience across.

      <p>
        <strong
          >What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
          the experience?:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        Clicking different buttons to navigate through the portfolio and access
        additional information.
      </p>

        <strong
          >What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?:</strong

      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        The primary goal of the website is to serve as a professional portfolio
        for Min Jea Seo. It showcases projects and career achievements in a
        structured, minimalistic way, making it easy for potential employers or
        clients to see whether she has the potential to design/create a website
        of their choosing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
          goal?:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        The design is clear and focused, with a strong emphasis on
        functionality. The main navigation elements - exploring her previous
        projects and accessing her resume full of experience are positioned to
        the centre of the screen so that users can quickly find the most
        relevant content. There are no ‘cool things’ but it also means that the
        user won’t get confused or distracted.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time?:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        The website is designed for short-term engagement rather than frequent
        revisits. Users are likely to visit once or twice to review Min Jea
        Seo’s work before deciding on potential collaboration or employment.
      </p>

          >How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        There aren’t any features the encourage the user to come back and keep
        interacting with the website as the user can’t really comment on any of
        the content shown. Instead, it’s more a static portfolio that strictly
        concentrates on it being proof of her works rather than a continuous
        evolving, updated page.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        The site takes inspiration from traditional resumes and professional
        portfolios. The clean layout resembles high-end design websites and has
        a conventional layout, mirroring corporate platforms like LinkedIn.
      </p>

          >What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        It suggests that users such as myself should treat it as a portfolio
        rather than a fun entertaining experience. Since it mimics a typical
        informative website it encourages users to take an employer perspective
        and glance at her redesigns and plugins to assess whether it fits the
        wants and needs a usual business website requires.
      </p>

        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        The minimalistic design and structured content create a sense of
        professionalism and credibility. It does not evoke excitement or
        playfulness but rather creates confidence in the viewer towards Min Jea
        Seo’s expertise.

          makes that part frustrating?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        The most frustrating part about this website is that it’s clear she’s
        very skilled but hasn’t added any twists to make it more appealing.
        There was just an overall lack of interactive elements or unique design
        choices that showcase her creativity. Even though that is what an
        employer usually wants she might not be able to distinguish herself from
        the other web developers that can do this as well. Adding slight
        animations or even the easiest interactive elements could make this
        website more memorable, otherwise there is nothing really special.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
          makes that part satisfying?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p id="answers1" class="fade-in">
        The ease of navigation and clarity of content were the most satisfying
        aspects. The website loads quickly, buttons function smoothly, and
        information is well-organised, making it a seamless experience for me
        when I was trying to look through everything the website contained.
