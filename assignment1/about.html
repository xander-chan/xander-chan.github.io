        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
          This interactive web project was created as part of an Interactive
          Media Assignment. The task required us to select an interactive web
          project from a list in the course modules and provide short written
          responses to the following prompts about our experience interacting
          with it. In this case I chose Min Jae Seo's simplistic and intuitive
          website design.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal was to explore this style of design and create an experience
          that not only answers the questions assigned but somewhat replicates
          her website. All credit to her of course and this won't be properly
          published.
