        <p class="fadein">
          This interactive web project was developed as part of an Interactive
          Media assignment. The task required us to choose an interactive web
          project from a provided list and respond to specific prompts about our
          experience engaging with it. I selected Min Jae Seoâ€™s website for its
          simplistic and intuitive design.
          <br />
          <br />
          My goal was to explore this design approach while crafting an
          experience that not only addresses the assigned questions but also
          mirrors the aesthetic and functionality of her site. Full credit goes
          to Min Jae Seo, and this project is purely for academic purposes
          rather than proper publication.
